# Disable_Zram🍉
This module Nukes*/Disable zram swap memory for better performance 

## Why this module 
It makes no sense to use 4096 MB of swap with 3.7 GB RAM free!

For those who are not into this, taken from RAM Truth:

Using swap increases your CPU usage, especially with zram where constant compression and decompression is going on (like using zip files on your PC), and is rarely beneficial on modern devices. Despite this, it's made a resurgence in the market.

Swap - A virtual memory scheme to increase your apparent total RAM. Unless you installed a modification to put this in storage, if you have swap you probably have a compressed block of RAM (called zram) acting as a virtual hard disk for this.

## Dependencies
Use the latest [Magisk](https://magiskmanager.com/) manager

## How to use?
 - flash the latest released .zip with magisk
 - reboot and profit*
